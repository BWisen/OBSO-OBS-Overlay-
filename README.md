A OBS Overlay that a lets you record, stream, replay, and save replay. working media controls and settings for OBS websocket and hotkey.
is kinda buggy im aware. could also be optimized better but gonna be honest i have no idea what im doing or if i will keep working on it lol.
would like to see something like this built into OBS one day or even just as a better program built upon this. 
dont be afraid to use the code and make something else with it.
